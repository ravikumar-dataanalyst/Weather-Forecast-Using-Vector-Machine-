Rain Prediction Project Using Support Vector Machine 

Tools Used:

Machine Learning Model to predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow using Support Vector Machine.

Work Process: 

1. Importing the preprocessed datasets for training, validation, and testing, where the following data preparation steps have been performed.
2.Splitting a dataset into training, validation & test sets || Filling/imputing missing values in numeric columns || Scaling numeric features to a (0,1) range || Encoding categorical columns as one-hot vectors.
3.Training and interpreting SVM
4. Overfitting & hyperparameter tuning
5. Making predictions on test set
6. Saving a model to disk
